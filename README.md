# A tragedy about a kitty bit my finger

This code is, at this stage, still under being designed. The current plan is as followes:

* Use Kinect to fetch the motion
* Use OpenCV to analyze the image 
* Project some image onto the dancer 
	* Human detection is required (Known)
	* Calculation of area of human image (FindContour + $$\alpha$$)
	* Detect the coordinate of the target (Human, Dancer whatever)

## Stay tuned!
